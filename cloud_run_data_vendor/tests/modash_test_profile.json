         "text":"Happy Monday! Today marks Week 3 as a doctor. Here\u2019s a few things I got to do/learn while on NICU.\n\nNeonatal PICC lines are so small, they look like strings! What is a PICC line? PICC lines (peripherally inserted central catheter) are similar to normal IVs, but they lead even further to larger veins that go directly into your heart \u2764\ufe0f PICC lines are used in patients that need longer treatment (if a patient needs TPN aka IV nutrition feeding), and to help administer certain meds that would otherwise cause irritation if it were given through a PIV \ud83d\udc89 You must be sterile, gowned & gloved during this procedure to prevent infections. Some PICC lines can stay in for almost a year.\n\nPremature babies should not be left at room temperature; they must be warmed. Why? For you & me, when we get cold, we have multiple mechanisms that protect us (shivering, peripheral vasoconstriction \ud83e\udd76), but preemies have only 1 way they can warm themselves. Preemies rely on fully stimulating their sympathetic system to maintain a normal body temp, expending up to 150 kcal/minute if left at room temperature on their own. Can you imagine burning a bag of chips just to exist? \ud83e\udd75 If preemies burn too much energy, they cannot grow. This is why you see incubators & radiant warmers in the NICU.\n\nAfter delivery, babies don\u2019t wear hats just be cute! \ud83e\udde4\ud83d\udc52 Because a baby\u2019s head has the largest surface area relative to the rest of its body, hats are worn to preserve their body heat.\n\nIf you made it this far, I\u2019m giving away 12 bags of luxurious Sconza chocolate coated cherries, coconut cashews, and lemon almonds to EACH of the 3 lucky winners (12 bags for each 1 winner!). Follow @medicalmyanne & @sconzachocolates. Tag 3 friends in the comments. Share this post on your Stories for 10 bonus entires. \u202aEnds Friday 7/17 at midnight\u202c. Good luck!\n\nAll photos subsequent to the first image are not my own. Photo credit from Google.",

I\u2019m starting this month in the Neonatal ICU \ud83d\udc76\ud83c\udffb (premature babies) and the experience thus far has been super interesting. Although I\u2019m not in Pediatrics, our Anesthesia residents still rotate through this service, and it\u2019s been amazing to see how much love and detail goes into caring for each baby \u2764\ufe0f They are so tiny \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude2d! \n\nThings have been super different in the hospital. Each morning, we get our temperature taken at the door, and are given stickers and surgical masks to wear. We wear our masks all day, from when we\u2019re charting on the computer to when we see patients. It\u2019s uncomfortable at first, but you get used to it after a few hours. Masks keep you & your loved ones protected, and it\u2019s important you wear one to respect your neighbors \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb I wonder whether this will become our new normal, even after COVID is \u201cover\u201d.\n\nIn the craziness of it all, still striving every day to navigate balancing sleep in residency. Some hacks I\u2019ve used for years is using a website called sleepyti.me to wake up at \u201ckey\u201d times I\u2019ll be most alert, taking power naps in 1.5 hour intervals, and using my weighted @myblanquil . It\u2019s a 15 lb weighted blanket that makes you feel safe, reduces stress, and simulates a hug \ud83e\udd7a Their company has been donating a ton of them to frontline HCPs during the pandemic, and if you\u2019d like one for yourself, feel free to use code \u201cMMA50\u201d for 50% off (not sponsored). If you have any tips for good sleep, please send them my way in the comments.\n\nWith the holiday weekend coming up, I urge you to distance yourself & celebrate responsibly. Please wear your mask, and respect thy neighbor \u2764\ufe0f",

         "text":"HOW TO GET INTO MED SCHOOL: Such a highly requested topic over the years & we\u2019re finally getting down to the grit of it! My background: I am a traditional, 1x applicant for the 2015-2016 cycle. I took no gap years & received both pre-match (offered med school admission before the official announcement date) and true match offers. I applied to in-state schools only (I am from Texas). YOUR MAJOR: I graduated from a state university with a BS in Bio & Chem minor. You don\u2019t have to be a STEM major to apply to med school (can be any major: music, fine arts), just as long as you do well in your premed prereqs.\n\nGPA/MCAT: Do as well as you can. You don\u2019t need a 4.0, but as much as we\u2019d like to think admissions is moving toward a holistic, well-rounded application, numbers do matter and are used to screen. Good scores show you have the discipline & tenacity to work hard consistently. If you have a low GPA, do better on your MCAT and vice versa. If you are struggling in your STEM classes, seek help ASAP (go to tutoring, TA sessions, talk to your professor). I took 2 months of dedicated summer study time with a Princeton prep course to take the old 45-scale MCAT. If I could do it over again, I would not do the course b/c it cost a lot of $ and if you have self-discipline and practice tests, that is enough.\n\nECs: Pick 2-3 clubs/orgs that mean a lot to you & commit. Climb the leadership ladder and put in the time. Don\u2019t spread yourself thin w/ 10 clubs. It does not only have to be premed related (can be church, sorority, culture). I picked pre-health clubs b/c I could find all my volunteer hours, leadership roles, and mentorship in 1 place, but I also enjoyed continuing my old hobbies like dance/piano & remained active in them.\n\nRESEARCH/GLOBAL MISSION TRIPS: Contrary to popular belief, you don\u2019t need any research or mission trips to get into med school (unless this is what interests you). More on this \u201cPremed series\u201d to come (character limit \ud83d\ude25)! I know applying to med school can be a huge beast & we\u2019re here for you. If you applied recently, what advice you can give below? Wearing @danielwellington \u201cPetite Melrose\u201d & bangle in Rose Gold. \u201cMEDICALMYANNE\u201d saves you 15% #ad",

         "text":"#ad About a year ago, I was getting sick every single month on the dot while on rotations. It was tough and incredibly uncomfortable, and my 3 essentials were always Vit C, a humidifier, and some sort of moisture for my nose. With seasonal allergies surrounding the holidays, it's super easy to start feeling nasal dryness and irritation - but these @Zicam Nasal AllClear swabs from can really help with that! They're easy to use, and their non-saline based moisturizing formula was perfect to cleanse, soothe, and protect my nostrils on those long days and crazy nights. What are your cold and allergy season essentials? Would love to hear below! @Zicam #NasalAllClear #Zicam",
